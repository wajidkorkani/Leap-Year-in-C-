# Leap Year and Month Days Checker

This program determines whether a given year is a leap year and displays the number of days in February for that year. It also allows the user to input a month number (1-12) and receive the number of days in that month, considering whether the year is a leap year or not.

## Features

1. **Leap Year Determination**:  
   The program checks if the entered year is a leap year or not based on the following rules:
   - A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4, except for years divisible by 100, unless they are also divisible by 400.
   
2. **Days in February**:  
   Based on whether the year is a leap year, the program informs the user if February has 28 or 29 days.

3. **Month Day Calculation**:  
   The program allows the user to input a month number (1 for January, 12 for December) and outputs the number of days in that month. It also considers leap years when determining the days in February.

4. **Input Validation**:  
   The program checks for valid month input (1-12). If the input is invalid, it prompts the user again.
